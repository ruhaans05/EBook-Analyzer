# EBook-Analyzer

This Python file includes code that finds the TF-IDF of five different texts. The first four texts are used for comparison purposes in my project, while the last one answers an additional open-ended question. Each cell's output is a table with the relevance of terms in each specific ebook. This project incorporates Pandas and regex methods to analyze the authors' word choices in their texts.
